# Minato 1866

Here you will find information firmwares, manual and images of the Minato 1866.

There are at least two versions of the Minato 1866. They are not distinguishable from the outside. The main digital logic board seems to be exactly the same, but the analog boards have different numbers, BN-83007-BTD versus BN-83007-CTD. My own Minato 1866, let's call it a V16, has the -BTD version and has some patch wires. In the -CTD version, that same area of the PCB is slightly revised. So it seems that the -CTD version is a bugfix board.

The reason for calling the -BTD version a V16, is that it came with a version V16 of the firmware. The -CTD version comes with a V24 firmware. The V24 firmware support a few extra eproms. I have tried the V24 firmware in my -BTD version, and I did not find any issues yet. I cannot fully guarantee it, but it seems as if both version of the 1866 are hardware compatible.

Take care that the Minato 1866**A** is an evolution of the Minato 1866, and is different enough that the firmwares cannot be interchanged between them.
